# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!).  Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://gitlab.com/-/experiment/new_project_readme_content:0c47a5e6b9cd30a4183d485ffa8a27c0?https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Meetup App 

## Description
The current application will allow you to facilitate the process of connecting with colleagues and friends by structuring the meetups or online meetings that you intend to hold. Create a topic for a call or discussion, maintain and edit it, schedule a call or a meeting at a convenient time for you. All your colleagues or friends will be able to follow the changes in future meetings and support topics of interest to them.

## Built With

The project was written using the following libraries and frameworks.

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [MUI](https://mui.com/)
* [Formik React](https://formik.org/)
* [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
* [axios.js](https://axios-http.com/)



## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.com/saminternship/dima-stukach.git
   ```
2. Go to project folder
   ```sh
   cd client
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. For server connect clone the following repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.com/saminternship/meetups-api.git
   ```
5. Install server NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
6. Start server, using following command
   ```sh
   node index.mjs
   ```
7. Go back to front-end project folder and run it using command
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
